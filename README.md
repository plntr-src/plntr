~ PLNTRLOT ~

A plant search engine that may either harmonize humanity with Kingdom Plantae ... or confuse a whole lotta people.

Planet Earth is a world overrun by plants. Some of us want to be their friends but don't really understand their ways.
PLNTRLOT is plopped on the intersection of USDA-approved databits and heirloom wisdom. Experienced gardeners and internet surfers can contribute to the knowledge base where there are holes. 

Happy PLNT-ing!
